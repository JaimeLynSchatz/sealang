Danny will love this!

Example: A grandfather clock is here. It is scenery with the description "The time is [the time of day in words]."

After examinging the clock for the first time: 
  move flashlight to the corridor,
  do more stuff here --- look at examples. this is so friggin cool!!

Ther's no time engine in inform7, but how could you implement that? Could you create a calendar object that switchesa property based on the time of day??

Damien said he had tried to implement a date object -- how would that work??

use >showme object_name to debug
You'll get a whole list of all of that item's properties
